      <p>
        A cartoon is a visual art form, typically hand-drawn or animated,
        presented in a non-realistic or semi-realistic style34. The modern
        interpretation of a cartoon includes a single image or a series of
        images meant to be satirical, humorous, or a caricature34. It can also
        refer to motion pictures that rely on a sequence of illustrations to
        create animation34. Creators of cartoons are known as cartoonists or
        animators3. Cartooning has roots in caricature, from the Italian word
        "caricare" which means to exaggerate or load1. Caricatures emphasize the
        subject’s most striking physical features for comic effect1. Cartoons
        often convey a message or highlight an irony, and their complexity
        varies based on the intended audience1. They represent aspects of life
        and can be humorous, serious, or even erotic2.

    <h3>History of Cartoons</h3>

    <p>
      The history of cartoons stretches from early 17th-century caricatures to
      modern-day animated films and webcomics. Originating in Italy, caricature
      made its way to Britain, where publications like Punch popularized
      satirical drawings. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the birth
      of animation with pioneers like J. Stuart Blackton and Émile Cohl, leading
      to the groundbreaking sound cartoon Steamboat Willie in 1928. Disney's
      Snow White set the stage for feature-length animated films, while the rise
      of television brought iconic series like The Flintstones. The late 20th
      century introduced computer animation with Pixar's Toy Story,
      revolutionizing the industry. Today, cartoons encompass diverse styles and
      formats globally, reflecting ongoing cultural and technological evolution.
